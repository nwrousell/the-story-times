# Overview
An online experience to help you connect and bond with friends and family far away by creating a "newspaper" filled with stories both real and fictitious. 

## Inspiration
Having recently moved away from home as college freshmen, we wanted to create something that would be a fun way to connect with family, friends, and other loved ones, even across long distances. We became very interested in the concept of getting people talking about their life experiences, as we've found that to be a great way to grow closer with others while learning interesting (and often surprising) new things about the people you love. And, in a  hackathon focusing on the retro, a collaborative newspaper seemed like the perfect way to tie all of these themes together in a fun and accessible way.
## How we built it
 - Built with React (Typescript)
 - Styled with TailwindCSS
 - Google Firestore as a database
 - Hand-drawn images to serve as the articles' "photographs"

## Challenges
 - Syncing data across "editors" of the newspaper
 - Emulating the classic newspaper style

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
 - Overall design / feel
 - Learned new things / had to tackle a different kind of project than what we're used to

## What we learned
Fast prototypes don't need the most elegant code, but spending time in the beginning thinking about the structure and flow of information is time well spent.

## What's next for The Story Times
 - Tweaking / balancing
 - Potentially other game modes (crossword, etc.)
